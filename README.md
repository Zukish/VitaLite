### Combat Prayer Plugin (New!)
Our latest addition automatically manages OSRS combat prayers for optimal performance:

- **Auto Prayer Switching**: Detects NPC attack styles (magic/ranged/melee) and applies appropriate protection prayers
- **Boss-Specific Support**: Pre-configured requirements for 40+ bosses including Vorkath (PIETY), Jad (REDEMPTION), Zulrah (RIGOUR), and more
- **Proper OSRS Mechanics**: Correct tick timing (1 tick minimum), proper prayer levels, and drain rates
- **UI Panel**: Visual monitoring of active prayers, combat state, and current target

*Note: This plugin requires manual PR submission due to GitHub API limitations*
